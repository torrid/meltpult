#Melting Point Apparatus 

You cannot repeat a melting process. This is especially true for substances that decompose when melted. You can – otoh – film the magnified melting capillary and the digital thermometer to capture that one and only melting process, without having to stare on it for minutes, unable to move. 
That's what I'm doing here. My melting block is a chunk of brass with some bore holes, my heating element a 40 Watt heating rod as used for 3D printing heads, and my temperature sensor a PT1000, coupled with an arduino and LED 7segment module.
