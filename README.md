### Melting Point Apparatus 

You cannot repeat a melting process. This is especially true for substances
that decompose when melted. You can – otoh – film the magnified melting
capillary and the digital thermometer to capture that one and only melting
process, without having to stare on it for minutes, unable to move.  That's
what I'm doing here. My melting block is a chunk of brass with some bore holes,
my heating element a 40 Watt heating rod as used for 3D printing heads, and my
temperature sensor a PT1000, coupled with an arduino and LED 7segment module. 

The heating element has 2 gears, fast & slow. I use an old Microsoft HD-5000
Webcam ("Hey, Microsoft ain't all bad, after all! They build fancy webcams...")
and v4lctl for capturing the process. 

### TODO 

* Upload the Arduino software. 
* Build some lens construction that is heat resistant to magnify the capillary.
